o	Ensure proper formatting of dates and numerical fields.

3.**Data Analysis**:

o	Use Excel tools like pivot tables, charts, and formulas to:

	Summarize sales data by product, category, region, and time.

	Track order fulfillment times and identify delays.
o	Apply conditional formatting to highlight key insights (e.g., high sales, underperforming products).
4.**Visualization**:

o	Create dashboards with charts (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, pie charts) to represent:

	Sales trends over time.
	Product and category performance.
	Regional sales distribution.
	Customer segmentation insights.
o	Use slicers for interactivity in pivot tables and dashboards.
5.**Insight Derivation**:
